JavaScript Book Club Exercises:

1. Let a = 5,  b = 1 and c = "5". Describe the outputs for the following scenario:
	
	 a = c 
		"=" is an assignment operator, so a will be set to a value of "5"
	 
	 a == b
	 
		"==" is a soft comparator, and it will return false since the values are not equal

	 a === c 

		"===" is a hard operator, so it will return false since the values are not the same type
	 
2. Let a = 4, b = 2 and c = 0. Describe the outputs for the following scenario:
	
	a && c
		Returns 0 since it's the first falsy value
	
	a & b
		0100 & 0010 - neither has 1s in the same place, so it'd return 0
	
	b || c
		
		Returns 2 since it's the first truthy value, and there is one true, one false.	

	a | c
		0100 | 0000 - returns the bits of either with a 1, so it'd return 0100 or 4
	
	a || ( b && ( !(a & b ) ) ) 

		Returns 4 since that's the first truthy value and they're both true. ( a & b = 0 -> !0 = true)
	
3.  A physics student gets unexpected resuts when using the code
		
		F = G * mass1 * mass2 / r * r
	
	to compute values according to Newtons Law of Gravitation. Explain the 
	problem and correct the code.
	Hint:
	https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence

	F = G * ( (mass1 * mass2) / (r * r) )
	Without the parathesis, the operators are read from left to right, so G is multiplied by mass1, then multiplied by mass2, etc. 
	The paranthesis allow for the equation to be done in the order in which the equation is intended


4. Using only what has been provided in ch.2, write a program that determines whether a given year is a leap year.
   Recall that leap years occur on years that are multiples of 4, but do not occur on years that are multiples of 100,
   unless they are also divisible by 400.

	var year;

	\\pretend the year is defined

	console.log("Is " + year + "a leap year?")

	leapYear = ((year % 4) == 0 ) || ( (year % 100) == 0 || ( (year % 400) == 0 ) );

	console.log(leapYear)

	\\This is hideous and terrible
